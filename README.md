West Nile Virus Prediction

## Problem Statement

West Nile Virus (Wnv), a mosquito-bourne arbovirus, has been causing significant and sometimes severe human diseases. Although pesticides are known to be effective in dealing with the virus-carrying mosquitoes, it is expensive to deploy pesticides throughout the city. As data scientists in the Division of Societal Cures in Epidemiology & New Creative Engineering, we want to understand the factors driving the spread of Wnv by leveraging on data collected by Chicago's weather stations and the surveillance system set up by the Chicago Department of Public Health. We also want to develop a classfication model that could predict the presence of Wnv within the area of Windy City. Through these studies, we hope to suggest a cost-efficient and effective method of deploying pesticides within the area.

## Summary

This project I demonstrate statistical analysis on the dataset, applying methods such as chi-squared and shapiro-wilks. I also conclude with some basic logistic and linear regression models. 

This project was previously part of a Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/overview

This project contains;
1 - data.csv - This is the csv file which contains the cleaned data used for the analysis
2 - Statistical Research.ipynb - contains the jupyter notebook with all the statistical analysis 
3 - utils.py - This is the utils library for some of the functions used in the jupyter notebook
